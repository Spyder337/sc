# ShellCommander

## Project Description

[ShellCommander][repo-cmd] is a collection of Rust ports of scripts that I've wrote/found online. The goal is to port all of my scripts to create commands that can be run from any shell. Not just nushell or powershell.

Shell scripts can be found [here][repo-shell].

To install the Rust crate, run the following command:

```sh
cargo install cmd
```

To develop the crate make sure that the rust nightly toolchain is installed.

    The quotes command will have four subcommands. These commands will allow for interacting with a local storage for quotes along with history of previous daily quotes. There will also be a link to a public API for providing quotes for in case the user wants to fetch a new quote.

    A potential providers: [Paper Quotes][api-paper-quotes], [Forbes Thoughts][api-forbes]

    > Note:
    > Forbes uses an API that provides for the quotes page. It's url is `http://www.forbes.com/forbesapi/thought/uri.json?enrich=true&query=1&relatedlimit=5`
